principles:
  - name: Responsiveness
    content: These days, it's not enough to just make an incredible, professionally-designed website. It also has to look good on a myriad of devices with differing sizes!  From TV to desktop, tablet to mobile, we seek to ensure the sites we make are just as awesome (and just as functional) on a huge range of screens.

  - name: Accessibility
    content: A website is only as good as the experience its users have with it. So it only makes sense to make it the best it can be. No website is can ever truly be well-designed without being accessible.  Accessibility is super important (and in some cases it's the law), so we design with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance at the top of our minds.

  - name: Integrity
    content: Your website is your message. We'll help you align it with your brand image, core mission, and personality.  At OverScore, we believe that a company or individual's website should be a reflection of them - real, personal, and genuine - down to the nitty-gritty fonts, colours, and animations.

  - name: Performance
    content: Got time to wait for a clunky old site to load? Didn't think so. Fact is, once you go fast, you never want to go back.  That's why we aim to write low-overhead, high-performance code that'll make your awesome new site load surprisingly quickly, even over satellite internet or emerging 2G, and you won't have to deal with thumb-twiddling lag, even on the slowest of devices.
