## How We Started:

OverScore Media was founded by two Trent University students, whose original intent was to back all of their entrepreneurial endeavours under a singular legal business name. After realizing the potential to grow this business into a fully-fledged software and digital design agency, they set their sights on building a central hub of talented creators to help local businesses upgrade every aspect of their online presence - and beyond. Since then, our team has grown into a network of Trent University students and alumni from Business Admin and CompSci, and other software professionals with an urge to create, and extra time on their hands to help us out ðŸ˜Š. So far, our team spans three continents!

## What We Do:
OverScore Media is currently dedicated to the following activities: 

### **Completing Contracts for our Clients [Businesses and Individuals]:**

In order to generate capital for the company, our members work with each other to provide a number of business development <a href="/services">services</a> to improve our clients' online presences. Our step-by-step process is:

1. Our clients can make service requests via our <a href="#contact--us">contact form</a> or through DM'ing us on social media. Once the request is received, an OverScore Project Manager will conduct a free, comprehensive consultation with them to acquire project specifications, and discuss a general estimate for timing and pricing. 

2. The Project Manager will then compose a team of hand-picked members of the OverScore team [themselves independent contractors who we sub-contract from time-to-time for the projects we know they're best at], allocate roles, distribute contracts, and initialize the project!

3. Practicing Agile development techniques, teams start pushing features and receiving feedback in divided iterations or "sprints".

4. Once our client's satisfied with the final result, our management team exchanges deliverables, along with a swanky invoice for services completed and payment due. [Note that for many projects a non-refundable deposit may be due at an earlier stage in the process, after requirements have been agreed to but before the work proper starts]

5. Finally, our management team distributes payment to our subcontractors based on the amounts we agreed upon, and the cycle can start afresh!

### **Developing Intra-Company Entrepreneurial Projects:**

As software and business developers on a warpath to glory, we all share the same desire to one day produce the next 'million dollar idea' - [or at least a million one-dollar ideas ðŸ˜‰]. What we really want is to stay "the good guys," and get the OverScore name associated with as many cool and useful projects as we can - altering the landscape of every industry we're a part of for the better in the process. Sure, it's by no means the easiest dream to attain, but that's the true reason we started this company in the first place. Using the income from our design, development, and strategic services, the foundation of our corporation, and the power of our network; we at OverScore plan on constructing as many personal projects as possible.
