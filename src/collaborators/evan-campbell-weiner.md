Evan Campbell-Weiner is a 4th Year Computer Science Co-op student at Trent University with aspirations to be a Full Stack Developer after graduation. Currently most of my work is focused on Web Development using the TALL stack. Through my co-op placements I've gained experience building web applications for production. I also spend a lot of my time working on additional projects for OverScore, charities, and hackathons.

Currently I spend most of my time with OverScore providing backend support including database management, routing logic, and project design.
