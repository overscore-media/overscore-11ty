Aspiring Software Architect and Agile Project Manager currently finishing Computing Systems degree at Trent University (proudly bleeding green). As co-founder and president of this company, there's no surprise that I spend a lot of time in various roles, but realistically my most important job is having a big mouth.  Confidently selling our organization to any and everyone that listens has become an enormous factor in our early growth.  In addition to this, I take on a lot of visually focussed jobs such as front-end development, front-end design, graphic design, and video editing.

My interests include just about anything under the scope of the tech and science industries: artificial intelligence, video games, engineering, you name it.  I've got quite a few plans for this business... an entire encyclopedia of back-burner projects await funding... and eventually they'll lead to world domination.
