We may process or share data based on the following legal bases:

>**Consent:** We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.

>**Legitimate Interests:** We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.

>**Performance of a Contract:** If we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to help fulfill the terms of our contract.

>**Legal Obligations:** We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable laws, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).

>**Vital Interests:** We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

Again, it is important to remember that the only personal information of yours we process is that which you decide to send us via our Contact Form or through other direct communication with OverScore Media.

### With Whom will Your Information be Shared?

We only share and disclose your information with the following third parties. We have categorized each party so that you may easily understand the purpose of our data collection and processing practices.

**Facilitating Contact Form submissions:**
[Netlify](https://netlify.com/) (your information is encrypted to them)

### Do We use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?

Nope. There's really no reason for us to do so. However, the embedded video players on our Website may make use of a few cookies, and there is annoyingly not much we can do about that. For YouTube videos, we use a nocookie link that disables tracking (but not necessarily all) cookies. As with any website you visit, you visit our Website at your own risk. 

That being said, we at OverScore Media believe that we have done due diligence to keep our site tracking-free. However, we do make use of the localStorage feature of most modern web browsers to store a small amount of non-personal data on your computer, alongside your browser's cached copy of this website. This data is meant to improve your experience with our Website, and **no** information (about your computer/web browser or otherwise) is automatically collected from it and sent to OverScore Media - or anyone else.

---

### How Long do we Keep Your Information?

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). We do not believe that any purpose (aside from entering into a contact or other business relationship with us) in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 180 days.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until complete deletion becomes possible.

---

### How do We Keep Your Information Safe?

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please remember that we cannot guarantee that any use of the Internet to access our site is ever 100% secure. Although _we_ will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our site is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment, using a modern web browser with the capacity to use the HTTPS (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure) version of our site using up-to-date TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption at least.

---

### Do we Collect Information from Minors?

We _do not_ knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the site, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of a legal minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the site. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under the age of 18, please contact us at [matthewpiercey@overscore.media](mailto:matthewpiercey@overscore.media?subject=OverScore%20Media%20-%20Privacy%20Policy)

### What are Your Privacy Rights?

If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: [https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm)

Further, we at OverScore Media view the right to a reasonable amount of privacy as a distinct human right that ought to be respected and upheld. To that end, as mentioned above, you can basically browse our site as a "ghost" as far as we know, since we don't track your session and don't collect any information from you unless you explicitly and knowingly give it to us.

---

### Controls for Do-Not-Track Requests

Some web browsers, mobile operating systems, and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has really been finalized (yet).

That being said, other than any information you may send to us through our Contact Form, we do not solicit any information from you or your web browser - nor do we track you in any way. DNT or DNT not, we will not track.

### Do California Residents have any Specific Privacy Rights?

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request to us using the contact information provided at the end of this policy. Albeit, it's worth noting, we do not disclose any information for direct marketing purposes, but you still have the right to ask anyway.

---

### Do We make Updates to this Policy?

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by a changed “Last Updated” date at the top of the Privacy Policy section of this page, and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be kept in the loop.
