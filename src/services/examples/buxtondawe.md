Looking for a simple business-card site to showcase your work? Look no further! With the power of Wordpress and Elementor, we were able to transform our client's outdated site into something much more visually appealing, in a short manner of time.

# Features

Buxton & Dawe is an established electrical contracting company with over 60 years of service in the GTA area and across Ontario. These were our goals with this project:

- Provide visitors with an overview of the company's services
- Display examples of past contracts
- Provide easily-accessible contact information
- Modern and visually-appealing design

The majority of the information that may interest a visitor can be discovered on the landing page, this includes:

A synopsis of the company,

A list of services with links to pages that elaborate on each service in more detail, along with short descriptions of those services,

# Development

The visual design was made with simplicity in mind, while still carrying the same boldness as the original branding from decades ago. This is accomplished using light translucent window elements overtop a fixed background, containing a few angled gradients. Yellow accents are used in areas like the navbar, to match the company's logo.

This project was made in Wordpress - not usually our cup of tea, but it was a fitting tool for the job, since we weren't making anything too complex. Wordpress gives us quite a few options for layout configuration, without having to write any code (not that writing code is a problem; we love doing that, too), plus it conveniently organizes aspects of development - like navigation, the media library, and styling into their own separate areas of the admin dashboard.

Elementor is a website builder for Wordpress that allows us to drag-and-drop responsive web components onto the page. All elements (minus the navigation bar) on the landing page and gallery were made this way, including the video background behind the title, services windows, the list of partners/organizations, and the contact window. When used correctly, Elementor can be a powerful and useful tool. In the hands of someone with limited web or design experience, however, we believe it could be quite cumbersome. Thus, we do not believe a caveat-free replacement for professional web developers exists - at least not yet. Until then, we who speak the "language of the web", as it were, will continue to develop our competencies in a number of areas, keep our skills up-to-date, and carefully evaluate and utilize the many web design and development tools available to us, of that you can be assured.
