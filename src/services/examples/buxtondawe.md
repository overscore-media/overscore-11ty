# Features

Buxton & Dawe is an established electrical contractor company with over 60 years of service in the GTA area and across Ontario.  The goal of this project is fairly straight forward; 

- Provide visitors with an overview of company services
- Display examples of past contracts
- Easily accessible contact information
- Modern and visually appealing design

The majority of the information a visitor may be interested in can be discovered on the landing page, this includes...

A synopsis of the company,

# Development

The visual design was made with simplicity in mind while still carrying the same boldness as the original branding from decades ago.  This is accomplished using light translucent window elements overtop of a fixed background containing a few angled gradients.  Yellow accents are used in areas like the navbar to match the company's logo.

This project was made in Wordpress, not usually our cup of tea but it was a fitting tool for the job since we weren't making anything too complex. Wordpress gives us quite a few options for layout configuration without having to write any code, plus it conveniently organizes aspects of development such as navigation, the media library, and styling into their own separate areas

Elementor is a website builder for wordpress that gives us even more ease of development by allowing us to drag and drop responsive web components onto the page.  All elements (minus the navigation bar) on the landing page and gallery were made this way, such as the video background behind the title, services windows, list of partners/organizations, and contact window.
