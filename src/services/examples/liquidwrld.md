Many small apparel and accessory brands today operate the majority of their business online, and for good reason; platforms such as Instagram serve as excellent marketing tools.  According to [hootsuite.com](https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/), 50% of instagram users have visited a website to make a purchase after seeing the product or service.  LiquidWRLD is an accessory brand that specializes in creating with heat reactive materials, generating unique products that are sure to catch the eye of any followers of the designer street wear theme.

# Features

Culturally this is an alternative street wear brand, so the layout of the site relies heavily on simplicity so the products don't get drowned out.  Our goal here is;

- Display a uncomplicated gallery of products
- A complete customer's journey
- Include a raffle page
- Capture the overall aesthetic of the brand

Luckily, the Wix eCommerce feature handles the entire buyer's journey for us.  What is arguably a longer, more tedious practice of setting up a products backend, a payment processor, shopping cart, and all other web store user interactions written with code is broken down and already prebuilt for us... all thats left to do is drop in the display we want to use.  Here we are using a simple gallery, clicking on any product will open up an individual page with more details and images available.  Users can add items they're interested in to the cart, then checkout once they're ready

Most streetwear websites lean towards minimalism or abstract designs, so we stuck to a clean black background with red accents.  A collage of photos taken for the brand and it's products appears underneath the gallery to further express the company's personality.

A raffle page has also been created, this is a special item where shoppers can enter in a draw to win prototype merchandise.

# Development

Although Wix isn't usually our first choice in platforms, building this site was a lot of fun.  Wix allows us to drag and drop frontend elements and media anywhere on the page, so there was tons of freedom to design in whatever way we choose to.  The flowing liquid background in the hero was created using stock footage from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/) and then some creative video editing in Hitfilm Express to adjust the colours and fade into the site's black background.

The collage underneath the store was puzzle pieced together in Figma - nothing much really in terms of technique, all the credit goes to the photographer for taking excellent shots that fit the aesthetic.

Wix also separates mobile and desktop views so that creating a responsive site isn't a balancing act
